# Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Data-Driven Machine Learning Strategy
Credit card fraud involves fraudsters gaining unauthorized access to someone else’s credit card or account, allowing them to make purchases or obtain cash advances without the cardholder’s consent.
Modern technology such as EMV chips, contactless payments, and virtual card numbers are applied to mitigate the risk of credit card skimming, cloning, or fraud. Despite these protections, it is crucial to take proactive measures to prevent credit card fraud and respond promptly if suspicious or fraudulent activity is observed.
Despite the utilization of technology and data analytics, including machine learning, in recent initiatives to combat credit card fraud, the issue remains prevalent. Hence, our project aims to develop innovative solutions to enhance fraud detection and mitigate these persistent challenges.

## Project Objectives
- **Thorough Analysis**: Delve into the complexities of credit card fraud detection, focusing on improving detection accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness.
- **Technological Exploration**: Evaluate and optimize current strategies and explore advanced methodologies to strengthen fraud detection systems.
- **Real-World Validation**: Test and validate our solutions within actual financial ecosystems to ensure scalability and effectiveness.
- **Impact Assessment**: Measure the success of our implementations in reducing false positives, securing financial transactions, and restoring trust.
- **User-Centric Design**: Create a methodology to develop a tool that is not only effective but also simple and easy to use for the everyday person. Our aim is to empower individuals with no technical background to leverage advanced machine learning solutions for protecting their financial transactions.

## Features
This repository hosts three detailed Jupyter notebooks, one on the main branch and two on additional branches, showcasing the application of five machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. 
Each notebook is commented to guide you through data exploration, preprocessing, and model evaluation based on **AUC**, **ROC Curve**, and **Accuracy** metrics.
